# GoXmpp
Make xmpp client more simple to use without complex setting.

Currently this code works well if after jabberd2 2.2.17 w or w/o TLS . (include in Ubuntu 14.04 TLS).

For 2.2.8(which Ubuntu 2.12.04 apt-get) it still has some issue

Using mattn / go-xmpp but make setting more easier if you just install jabberd2 without any specific configuration.
